# Real-Time Data Pipeline Project Overview

This project demonstrates the development of a real-time data pipeline leveraging AWS services, Python, Apache Airflow, and Spark to process and analyze weather data.

The architecture involves extracting data from the OpenWeather API, storing it in S3, transforming it via AWS Glue, and loading it into Redshift for analysis.
